What does the man mean? Gary insisted on buying the food for the picnic. That's pretty generous of him. But shouldn't we at least offer to share the expenses? He has a big family to support. What does the woman suggest they do? Did you see the headlines in the paper this morning? Yeah. Apparently the bus company will be laying off its employees if they can't reach an agreement on wages by midnight. What did the man read about? Have we received payment for the overseas  order we delivered last month? Yes. The cheque came in yesterday afternoon. I'll be depositing it when I go to the bank today.
