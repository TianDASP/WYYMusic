{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":6,"lyric":"[00:00.00] Florence Hayes  is a journalist  for the Green Ville Journal, the daily newspaper in town. Specifically  she covers crime  in the Green Ville area. This responsibility takes her to many different places  every week ——the police station, the court  and the hospital. Most of the crimes that she writes about  fall into two groups: violent crimes  and crimes against property. There isn’t much violent crime in a small town like Green Ville, or at least not as much  as in the large  urban areas. But assaults  often occur on Friday  and Saturday nights, near the bars downtown. There’re also one or two rapes on campus  every semester. Florence  is very interested  in this type of crime  and tries to write  a long article  about each one. She expects  that this will make women more careful  when they walk around Green Ville  alone at night  Fortunately, there were usually no murders in Green Ville. Crimes against property  make up most of Miss Heyes’ reporting. They range from minor cases  of deliberate  damaging of things  to much more serious offenses, such as car accidents  involving drunk drivers  or bank robberies  but Florence has to report  all of these violations  from the thief  who took typewriters  from every unlock room in the dormitory  to the thief  who stole one million dollars worth of art work  from the university museum. Miss Hayes  enjoys working for a newspaper  but she sometimes gets  unhappy  about all the crime she has to report. She would prefer to start writing  about something more interesting  and less  unpleasant  such as local news  or politics, maybe next year.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[660,112840](660,450,0)Florence (1110,570,0)Hayes (1680,150,0)is (1830,60,0)a (1890,720,0)journalist (2610,120,0)for (2730,120,0)the (2850,360,0)Green (3210,240,0)Ville (3450,630,0)Journal(4080,60,0), (4140,150,0)the (4290,360,0)daily (4650,690,0)newspaper (5340,150,0)in (5490,510,0)town(6000,690,0).
