That’s right. Now it seems that a hand gun was found in your luggage. Do you admit that? Yes, but…  According to the statement you made, you had never seen the hand gun before it was found in your bag. Do you still maintain that? But it’s true. I swear it. Mmm, you do realize Mr. Kumar  that to bring a hand gun into Hong Kong without proper authorization  is a serious offense. But I didn’t bring it. I … I mean  I didn’t know anything about it. It wasn’t there when I left Delhi. My bags were searched. It was part of the airport security check. Maybe so, but someone managed to get that hand gun onto the aircraft  or it couldn’t have been there. Someone  but not me. Tell me, where was your personal bag during the flight? I had it down by my feet  between me  and the man in the next seat.He was the only person who could have opened my bag while I was asleep. It must have been him. I see. Have you any idea who this man was? He told me his name, Alfred Foster. He was very friendly, after I woke up that is. He hadn’t spoken before. Alfred Foster, we can check that on the passenger list. He said he had a car coming to meet him. He offered me a lift. Oh, Why should he do that? So he can get his handgun back, that’s why. Please find him, Madam.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[300,91800](300,240,0)Your (540,420,0)name (960,540,0)Sanjay (1500,630,0)Kumar (2130,60,0)is (2190,180,0)that (2370,450,0)correct(2820,120,0)?
