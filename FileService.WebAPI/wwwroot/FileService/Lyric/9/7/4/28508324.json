{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":7,"lyric":"[00:00.00] What a wonderful performance! Your rock band has never sounded better. Many thanks. I guess all those hours of practice in the past month are finally paying off. What does the man mean? I can't decide what to do for my summer vacation. I  either want to go on a bike tour of Europe  or go diving in Mexico. Well, we're offering an all-inclusive two-week trip to Mexico for only $300. What does the woman suggest the man do for his vacation? How long do you think this project might take? I'd say about three months, but it could take longer if something unexpected happened. Maybe we'd better allow an extra month, so we won't have to worry about being late. Why does the man say extra time should be allowed for the project? I'm thinking about becoming a member here, and I'd like some information. Sure. A three-month membership costs  $150, and that includes use of the wait-room, sauna  and pool. I'll give you a free path  so that you can try out the facilities before you decide. What do we learn from the conversation?\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[2250,121260](2250,390,0)What (2640,120,0)a (2760,600,0)wonderful (3360,1140,0)performance (4500,240,0)Your (4740,360,0)rock (5100,360,0)band (5460,240,0)has (5700,390,0)never (6090,420,0)sounded (6510,1050,0)better(7560,0,0).(7560,390,0)Many (7950,1050,0)thanks(9000,0,0).(9000,210,0)I (9210,330,0)guess (9540,180,0)all (9720,330,0)those (10050,360,0)hours (10410,90,0)of (10500,690,0)practice (11190,150,0)in (11340,60,0)the (11400,420,0)past (11820,450,0)month (12270,120,0)are (12390,600,0)finally (12990,390,0)paying (13380,990,0)off(14370,0,0).(14370,420,0)What (14790,210,0)does (15000,120,0)the (15120,360,0)man (15480,15720,0)mean (31200,300,0)I (31500,450,0)can't (31950,540,0)decide (32490,210,0)what (32700,150,0)to (32850,270,0)do (33120,180,0)for (33300,150,0)my (33450,330,0)summer (33780,1440,0)vacation(35220,0,0).(35220,300,0)I (35520,330,0)either (35850,240,0)want (36090,150,0)to (36240,240,0)go (36480,120,0)on (36600,60,0)a (36660,360,0)bike (37020,300,0)tour (37320,120,0)of (37440,630,0)Europe (38070,330,0)or (38400,240,0)go (38640,480,0)diving (39120,120,0)in (39240,930,0)Mexico(40170,0,0).(40170,540,0)Well (40710,330,0)we're (41040,480,0)offering (41520,210,0)an (41730,1020,0)allinclusive (42750,570,0)twoweek (43320,330,0)trip (43650,150,0)to (43800,690,0)Mexico (44490,300,0)for (44790,390,0)only (45180,2580,0)300(47760,0,0).(47760,420,0)What (48180,210,0)does (48390,90,0)the (48480,300,0)woman (48780,630,0)suggest (49410,90,0)the (49500,300,0)man (49800,300,0)do (50100,210,0)for (50310,180,0)his (50490,15960,0)vacation (66450,300,0)How (66750,300,0)long (67050,180,0)do (67230,150,0)you (67380,300,0)think (67680,240,0)this (67920,570,0)project (68490,240,0)might (68730,1020,0)take (69750,390,0)I'd (70140,360,0)say (70500,390,0)about (70890,330,0)three (71220,930,0)months (72150,210,0)but (72360,120,0)it (72480,240,0)could (72720,300,0)take (73020,420,0)longer (73440,120,0)if (73560,510,0)something (74070,750,0)unexpected (74820,1200,0)happened(76020,0,0).(76020,540,0)Maybe (76560,270,0)we'd (76830,360,0)better (77190,270,0)allow (77460,120,0)an (77580,390,0)extra (77970,510,0)month (78480,240,0)so (78720,150,0)we (78870,270,0)won't (79140,150,0)have (79290,150,0)to (79440,300,0)worry (79740,270,0)about (80010,270,0)being (80280,990,0)late(81270,0,0).(81270,360,0)Why (81630,240,0)does (81870,120,0)the (81990,330,0)man (82320,450,0)say (82770,450,0)extra (83220,480,0)time (83700,210,0)should (83910,180,0)be (84090,510,0)allowed (84600,180,0)for (84780,120,0)the (84900,16590,0)project (101490,330,0)I'm (101820,450,0)thinking (102270,300,0)about (102570,480,0)becoming (103050,60,0)a (103110,390,0)member (103500,480,0)here (103980,240,0)and (104220,150,0)I'd (104370,210,0)like (104580,180,0)some (104760,930,0)information(105690,0,0).(105690,1050,0)Sure(106740,0,0).(106740,120,0)A (106860,660,0)threemonth (107520,660,0)membership (108180,1620,0)costs (109800,840,0)150 (110640,210,0)and (110850,210,0)that (111060,510,0)includes (111570,300,0)use (111870,120,0)of (111990,90,0)the (112080,690,0)waitroom (112770,690,0)sauna (113460,240,0)and (113700,1050,0)pool(114750,0,0).(114750,240,0)I'll (114990,210,0)give (115200,180,0)you (115380,90,0)a (115470,300,0)free (115770,660,0)path (116430,240,0)so (116670,180,0)that (116850,150,0)you (117000,210,0)can (117210,390,0)try (117600,180,0)out (117780,120,0)the (117900,780,0)facilities (118680,510,0)before (119190,150,0)you (119340,1620,0)decide(120960,0,0).(120960,270,0)What (121230,120,0)do (121350,120,0)we (121470,390,0)learn (121860,210,0)from (122070,90,0)the (122160,1350,0)conversation\n"},"code":200,"roles":[]}
