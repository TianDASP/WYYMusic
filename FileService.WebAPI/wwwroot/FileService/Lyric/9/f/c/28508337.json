{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":6,"lyric":"[00:00.00] So,what's the next thing on the agenda, Mary? Well, it's the South Theater Company. They want to know if we'd be interested in sponsoring a tour they want to make to East Asia. East Asia? Uhh... and how much  are they hoping to get from us? Well, the letter mentions  ￡20,000, but I don't know if they might settle for us. Do they say what they would cover? Have they anything specific in mind? No, I think they are just asking all the firms in tongue for as much money as they think they'll give. And we are worth ￡20,000, right? It seems so. Very flattering. But  I am not awfully happy with the idea. What we get out of it? Oh, good publicity I suppose. So what I suggest is not that we just give them a sum of money, but that we offer to pay for something specific  like travel or something, and that in return, we ask for our name to be printed prominently in the program, and that they give us  free  advertising space in it. But the travel bill would be enormous, and we could never manage that. I know. But why don't we offer to pay for the printing of the programs ourselves  on condition that on the front cover there's something like  this program is presented with the compliments  of Norland Electronics, and free advertising of course. Good idea. Well, let's get back to them and ask what the program they want will cost. Then we can see if we are interested or not.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[210,89210](210,420,0)So(630,60,0),(690,360,0)what's (1050,150,0)the (1200,330,0)next (1530,210,0)thing (1740,120,0)on (1860,120,0)the (1980,450,0)agenda(2430,0,0), (2430,450,0)Mary(2880,360,0)?
