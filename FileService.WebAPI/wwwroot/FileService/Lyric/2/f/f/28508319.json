A developmental biologist and tissue engineer, Dr. Mironov, is one of only a few scientists  worldwide  involved in bioengineering 'cultured' meats. It's a product he believes could help solve future global food crises  resulting from shrinking amounts of land  available for growing meat the old-fashioned way. \" Growth of cultured meat  is also underway in the Netherlands,\"  Mironov told Reuters  in an interview. \" But in the United States, it is science in search of funding and demand.\" \" The new National  Institute  of Food and Agriculture  won't fund it, the National Institutes of Health  won't fund it, and NASA funded it only briefly,\" Mironov said. \" It's classic disruptive technology,\" Mironov said. \" Bringing any new technology on the market, on average, costs $1  billion. We don't even have $1 million.\"  Director of the Advanced Tissue Biofabrication Center  in the Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology  at the medical university, Mironov now primarily conducts research on tissue engineering  or growing of human organs. \" There's an unpleasant factor when people find out meat  is grown in a lab. They don't like to associate technology  with food,\"  said Nicholas Genovese, a visiting scholar in cancer cell biology. \" But there are a lot of products that we eat today  that are considered natural  that are produced in a similar manner,\"  Genovese said.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[900,117640](900,210,0)In (1110,120,0)a (1230,420,0)small (1650,870,0)laboratory (2520,150,0)at (2670,90,0)the (2760,450,0)Medical (3210,780,0)University (3990,90,0)of (4080,360,0)South (4440,780,0)Carolina(5220,390,0), (5610,420,0)Dr(6030,0,0).
