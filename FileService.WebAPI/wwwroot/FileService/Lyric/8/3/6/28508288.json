{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":6,"lyric":"[00:00.00] The University of Tennessee's Walters Life Sciences building, is a model animal facility, spotlessly clean, careful in obtaining prior approval for experiments  from an animal care committee. Of the 15,000 mice house there in a typical year, most give their lives for humanity. These  are  good mice  and as such won  the protection of the animal care committee. At any given time however  some mice  escape and run free. These mice  are pests. They can disrupt experiments with the bacteria organisms they carry. They are bad mice  and must be captured  and destroyed. Usually, this is accomplished by means of sticky traps, a kind of fly paper  on which they become increasingly stuck. But the real point of the cautionary tale, says animal behaviorist Herzau, is  that the labels we put on things can affect our moral responses to them. Using stick traps  or the more deadly snap traps  would be deemed unacceptable for good mice. Yet the killing of bad mice  requires no prior approval. Once the research animal hits the floor and becomes an escapee, says Herza, its moral standard  is instantly diminished. In Herzau's own home, there was more ironic example  when his young son's pet mouse  Willy died recently, it was accorded a tearful ceremonial burial in garden. Yet even as they mourned Willy, says Herzau, he and his wife  were setting snap traps to kill the pest mice  in their kitchen  with the bare change in labels from pet  to pest, the kitchen mice obtained  totally different moral standards  Question 26  What does the passage say about most of the mice used for experiments? Question 27  Why did the so-called bad mice  have to be captured and destroyed? Question 28  When are mice killed without prior approval? Question 29  Why does the speaker say what the Herzau's did at home is ironical?\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[720,151120](720,180,0)The (900,720,0)University (1620,90,0)of (1710,690,0)Tennessee's (2400,600,0)Walters (3000,300,0)Life (3300,630,0)Sciences (3930,510,0)building(4440,360,0), (4800,210,0)is (5010,60,0)a (5070,390,0)model (5460,330,0)animal (5790,690,0)facility(6480,210,0), (6690,900,0)spotlessly (7590,750,0)clean(8340,30,0), (8370,540,0)careful (8910,120,0)in (9030,540,0)obtaining (9570,450,0)prior (10020,540,0)approval (10560,270,0)for (10830,990,0)experiments (11820,240,0)from (12060,120,0)an (12180,390,0)animal (12570,330,0)care (12900,570,0)committee(13470,1020,0).
