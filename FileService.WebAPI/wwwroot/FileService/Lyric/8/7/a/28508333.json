is the picture you have of yourself, the sort of person you believe you are.\n[00:07.156]Included in your self-image are the categories in which you place yourself, the roles you play and other similar descriptors you use to identify yourself.\n[00:17.989]If you tell an acquaintance you are a grandfather who recently lost his wife and who does volunteer work on weekends, several elements of your self-image are brought to light — the roles of grandparent, widower and conscientious citizen.\n[00:34.538]But self-image is more than how you picture yourself;it also involves how others see you.\n[00:40.713]Three types of feedback from others are indicative of how they see us: conformation, rejection, and disconfirmation.\n[00:49.403]Conformation occurs when others treat you in a manner consistent with who you believe you are.\n[00:55.582]You believe you have leadership abilities and your boss put you in charge of a new work team.\n[01:01.031]On the other hand, rejection occurs when others treat you in a manner that is inconsistent with yourself definition.\n[01:08.558]Pierre Salinger was appointed senator from California, but subsequently lost his first election.\n[01:14.784]He thought he was a good public official, but the voters obviously thought otherwise — Their vote was inconsistent with his self-concept.\n[01:24.382]The third type of feedback is disconfirmation, which occurs when others fail to respond to your notion of self by responding neutrally.\n[01:32.962]A student writes what he thinks is an excellent composition, but the teacher writes no encouraging remarks.\n[01:39.946]Rather than relying on how others classify you, consider how you identify yourself.\n[01:46.178]The way in which you identify yourself is the best reflection of your self-image.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":9,"lyric":"[by:刘好念]\n[00:00.179]自我形象是对自己的印象，你认为自己是哪一类人。\n[00:07.156]自我形象包括你将自己归类为哪一类人，你扮演什么样的角色或者其他类似的用于自我定义的描述。\n[00:17.989]如果你告诉一个相熟的人你是一个最近失去了妻子并且在周末做义工的祖父，那么可以发现关于你的自我形象的几个元素：祖父、鳏夫和有责任感的市民。\n[00:34.538]但是自我形象不仅仅是自己对于自己的印象，还包括其他人如何看待你。\n[00:40.713]他人如何看待我们的反馈可以分为三种类型，分别是：一致、排斥和不确定。\n[00:49.403]一致的反馈即当他人对你的看法与你自己对自己的看法一致。\n[00:55.582]例如你认为自己具有领导能力同时你的上司让你领导一个新的工作小组。\n[01:01.031]另一方面，排斥反馈即他人对你的看法与你自己对自己的看法不同。\n[01:08.558]Pierre Salinger是 加利福尼亚州的参议员，但是他输掉了自己的第一次选举。\n[01:14.784]即使他自认为自己是一个优秀的政府工作人员，但是其他投票者显然并不这么认为。投票者的表决与他对自己的评价不一致。\n[01:24.382]第三种反馈类型为不确定反馈。出现在他人没有正面地回应你对自己的观点而是以中立的观点回应你。\n[01:32.962]例如，一个学生写了一篇自认为很优秀的文章，但是老师并没有写下任何鼓励的评价。\n[01:39.946]关心自己如何定义自己，而不要取决于他人将你分为哪一类。\n[01:46.178]自己如何看待自己才是自我形象最好的反映。\n"},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":3,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[840,6120](840,510,0)Self(1350,60,0)-(1410,480,0)image
