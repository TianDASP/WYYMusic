Could you come back in a few minutes? What does the woman mean? Question 12  I hope you're not too put out with me for the delay. I have to stop by friends' home to pick up a book on my way here. Well, that's not a big deal. But you might at least phone  if you know you're going to keep someone waiting. What do we learn about the woman from the conversation? Question 13  Mark is the best candidate for chairman of the student union, isn't he? Well, that guy won't be able to win the election  unless he gets some majority vote  from women students. And I'm not sure about that. What does the man mean? Question 14  Sorry to have kept you waiting, Madam. I've located your luggage. It was left behind in Paris  and won't arrive until later this evening. Oh, I can't believe this. Have it deliver to my hotel then, I guess. What happened to the woman's luggage? Question 15  I don't think we have enough information for our presentation, but we have to give it tomorrow. There doesn't seem to be much we can do about it. Yeah, at this point we 'll have to make do with what we've got. What does the man suggest they do? Question 16  I am taking this great course-Psychology of Language, it's really interesting. Since you are a psychology major, you should sign up for it. Actually  I tried to do that, but they told me I have to take language studies first. What do we learn from the conversation? Question 17  Can you believe the way Larry was talking to his roommate? No wonder they don't get along. Well, maybe Larry was just reacting to something his roommate said. There are two sides to every story you know. What does the man imply about Larry and his roommate? Question 18  We don't have the resources to stop those people from buying us out  unless a miracle happens. This may be the end of us. I still have hope we can get help from the bank. After all  we don't need that much money.
