Well, I got it from the headlines this morning. It's reported that he made public at this decision at the last cabinet meeting. what do we learn about Jame Smeil? Question 16  The morning paper says the space shuttle is taking off at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Yeah, it's just another one of this year's routine missions. The first mission was undertaken a decade ago and broadcast live then worldwide. what can we infer from this conversation? Question 17  We do a lot of camping in the mountains. What would you recommend for two people? You'd probably be better off with the four real drive vehicle. We have several off road trucks in stock, both new  and used. Where does the conversation most probably take place? Question  18  I hear you did some serious shopping this past weekend. Yeah, the speakers of my old stereo finally gave out and there was no way to repair them.
