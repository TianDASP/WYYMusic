the past, one of the biggest disadvantages of machines has been their inability to work on a microscale.\n[00:07.000]For example, doctors did not have devices allowing them to go inside the human body to detect health problems, or to perform delicate surgery.\n[00:18.000]Repair crews did not have a way of identifying broken pipes located deep within a high-rise apartment building.\n[00:25.000]However, that's about to change.\n[00:27.000]Advances in computers and biophysics have started a micro miniature revolution that allows scientists to envision and in somes cases actually build microscopic machines.\n[00:41.000]These devises promise to dramatically change the way we live and work.\n[00:46.000]Micromachines already are making an impact.\n[00:49.000]At Case Western Reverse University in Cleveland, Ohio, research scientists have designed a 4-inch silicon chip that holds 700 tiny primitive motors.\n[01:02.000]At Lucas Nova Sensor in Fremont, California, scientists have perfected the world's first microscopic blood-pressure sensor.\n[01:11.000]Threaded through a person's blood vessels, the sensor can provide blood pressure readings at the valve of the heart itself.\n[01:18.000]Although simple versions of miniature devices have had an impact, advanced versions are still several years away.\n[01:26.000]Auto manufacturers, for example, are trying to use tiny devices that can sense when to release an airbag, and how to keep engines and brakes operating efficiently.\n[01:38.000]Some futurists envision nanotechnology also being used to explore the deep sea in small submarines, or even to launch finger-sized rockets packed with micro miniature instruments.\n[01:52.000]There is an explosion of new ideas and applications.\n[01:56.000]So when scientists now think about future machines doing large and complex tasks, they're thinking smaller than ever before.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":27,"lyric":"[by:Silvasco]\n[00:00.300]机器在过去最大的劣势之一是它们不能在微尺度上作业.\n[00:07.000]例如, 医生们没有设备能让他们在人体内检查健康问题或是进行微型手术.\n[00:18.000]维修人员没有办法找出隐藏在高层公寓楼深处的坏掉的管道.\n[00:25.000]然而, 这些情况现在变了.\n[00:27.000]计算机和生物物理学的进步开始了微型模型的革命, 能够让科学家们预想, 有时甚至是制造出微型机器.\n[00:41.000]这些设备有望深刻地改变我们生活和工作的方式.\n[00:46.000]微型机器已经在产生影响了.\n[00:49.000]在俄亥俄州克利夫兰市的凯撒西储大学, 研究科学家们设计出了一个能够支持700个原始马达的四英寸的硅片.\n[01:02.000]在加利福尼亚州弗里蒙市的新卢卡斯传感器, 科学家们改善了世界第一个微型的血压传感器.\n[01:11.000]这种传感器用线穿过一个人的血管, 它能够自己在心脏瓣膜处提供血压监测.\n[01:18.000]尽管微型设备的简化版本已经有了效果, 更先进的版本仍然还要几年.\n[01:26.000]例如, 汽车经销商们尽力去使用那些能够感知什么时候弹出安全气囊, 以及如何去保持引擎和刹车有效运转的微型设备.\n[01:38.000]一些未来主义者预想, 纳米技术也正在被用在小型潜水艇中来探索深海, 或甚至去发射手指大小的带有微型仪器的火箭.\n[01:52.000]在创意和应用方面已经有了爆发式的突破.\n[01:56.000]因此, 当如今科学家们考虑未来的机器去做大型复杂作业的时候,
