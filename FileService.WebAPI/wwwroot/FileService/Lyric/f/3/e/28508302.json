That sounds like a great thing, but as a recent study has shown, too many choices  can make us confused, unhappy, even paralyzed with indecision. \" That's particularly true  when it comes to the work place\", says Barry Schwartz, an author of six books  about human behavior. Students are graduating  with a variety of skills  and interests, but often find themselves  overwhelmed  when it comes to choosing  an ultimate career goal. In a study, Schwartz  observed decision-making  among college students  during their senior year. Based on answers to questions regarding their job hunting strategies  and career decisions, he divided the students  into two groups：maximizers, who consider  every possible option, and satisficers, who look  until they find an option that is good enough. You might expect that the student  who had undertaken the most  exhausted search  would be the most satisfied with their final decision, but it turns out that’s not true. Schwartz found that while maximizers ended up with better-paying jobs than satisficers on average, they weren’t as happy with their decision. The reason why these people feel less satisfied  is that a world of possibilities  may also be a world  of missed opportunities. When you look at every possible option, you tend to focus more on what was given up  than what was gained. After surveying every option, a person is more acutely aware of the opportunities  they had to turn down  to pursue just one career.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[3450,116600](3450,150,0)In (3600,840,0)America(4440,60,0), (4500,330,0)people (4830,90,0)are (4920,420,0)faced (5340,180,0)with (5520,390,0)more (5910,150,0)and (6060,240,0)more (6300,690,0)decisions (6990,330,0)every (7320,330,0)day(7650,420,0), (8070,300,0)whether (8370,150,0)it(8520,30,0)’(8550,60,0)s (8610,330,0)picking (8940,270,0)one (9210,90,0)of (9300,420,0)thirty(9720,30,0)-(9750,210,0)one (9960,300,0)ice (10260,300,0)cream (10560,810,0)flavors(11370,30,0), (11400,180,0)or (11580,600,0)deciding (12180,480,0)whether (12660,210,0)and (12870,390,0)when (13260,120,0)to (13380,180,0)get (13560,450,0)married(14010,990,0).
