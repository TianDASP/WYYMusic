No one was able to get through yesterday. My telephone was disconnected by the phone company. What does the woman ask the man about? Question 12 I finally found a really nice apartment that's within my price range. Congratulations! Affordable housing is rare in this city. I've been looking for a suitable place since I got here six months ago. What does the man mean? Question 13 I got this in my mailbox today, but I don't know what it is. Do you have any idea? Oh, that's your number for the new photocopier. It acquires an access code. Everyone got one. What do we learn from the conversation? Question 14 Jane told me that you'll be leaving at soon. Is it true? Yeah, my wife's maternity leave is close to an end. And since she wants to go back to work, I've decided to take a year off to raise the baby. What does the man mean?\n\n\n问题11 A:Gray，你的电话出什么问题了？昨天我试着打你的电话打了一整晚。 B：不好意思，昨晚没人能打进我的手机，我的手机无法连接到电话公司了。 Q：对话中女的问了男的什么？ 问题12 A：我终于找到了一个在相当好的公寓，而且在我的预算内。 B：恭喜你!在这个城市里，买得起的房源太稀有了，自从六个月前来到这里，我就一直在找合适的房子。 问题13 A：我在邮箱里收到了这个，但是我不知道它是什么，你知道吗？ B：哦，这是新复印机的密码，新的复印机需要通行密码，每个人都有一个。 Q：在这个对话中我们能知道什么信息？ 问题14 A：Jane告诉我你很快就要离职了，是真的吗？ Ｂ：是的，我妻子的产假就要结束了，她想回去工作，所以我决定离职一年回家照顾孩子。"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"code":200,"roles":[]}
