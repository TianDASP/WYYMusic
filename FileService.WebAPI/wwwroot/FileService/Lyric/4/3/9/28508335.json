{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":6,"lyric":"[00:00.00] A recent study shows that meat consumption is one of the main ways that humans can damage the environment, second only to the use of motor vehicles. So  how can eating meat have a negative effect on the environment? For a start, all animals, such as cows, pigs and sheep  release a gas named methane, which is the second most common green house gas  after carbon dioxide. Many environmental experts now believe  that methane is more responsible for global warming  than carbon dioxide. It is estimated  that 25% of all methane released into the atmosphere  comes from farm animals. Another way in which meat production affects the environment  is through the use of water  and land. 2,500  gallons of water  are needed to produce one pound of beef, while as 20  gallons of water are needed to produce one pound of wheat. One acre of farmland used for raising cows  can produce 250  pounds of beef. One acre of farmland used for crop production can produce  50,000 pounds of tomatoes. Many people now see the benefits of switching to vegetarian diet  which excludes meat  and fish. Not just for health reasons, but also because it plays a vital role in protecting the environment. However, some nutritionists advise against switching to a totally strict vegetarian diet. They believe such a diet which includes no products from animal sources  can be deficient in many of the necessary vitamins  and minerals our bodies need. Today  many people have come to realize that help the environment  and for the human race to survive, more of us will need to become vegetarian.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[630,107510](630,120,0)A (750,390,0)recent (1140,330,0)study (1470,420,0)shows (1890,150,0)that (2040,210,0)meat (2250,750,0)consumption (3000,180,0)is (3180,120,0)one (3300,90,0)of (3390,90,0)the (3480,330,0)main (3810,390,0)ways (4200,150,0)that (4350,420,0)humans (4770,150,0)can (4920,450,0)damage (5370,90,0)the (5460,930,0)environment(6390,300,0), (6690,510,0)second (7200,270,0)only (7470,150,0)to (7620,90,0)the (7710,570,0)use (8280,180,0)of (8460,240,0)motor (8700,810,0)vehicles(9510,570,0).
