a vacant parking space by a computer-controlled device similar to an elevator that also runs sideways.\n[01:08.726]There is no human supervision,\n[01:10.598]but an attendant will be on hand to accept cash and explain the system to new users.\n[01:16.165]Parking rates will be attracted about $400 monthly or $25 per day,\n[01:23.112]according to Ari Milstein, the director of planning for Automation Parking Systems,\n[01:28.958]which is the U.S. subsidiary of a German company.\n[01:32.943]This company has built automated garages in several countries overseas\n[01:37.467]and in the United States
