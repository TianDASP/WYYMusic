I rang earlier and asked for some information about Dennis Hutton, the scientist. You asked me to ring back. Oh, yes. I have found something. Good. I've got a pencil and paper. Perhaps you could read out what it says. Certainly. Hutton  Dennis, born  Darlington, 1836, died  New York, 1920. Yes, got that. Inventer and physicist, the son of a farmworker. He was admitted to the University of London  at the age of 15. Yes. He graduated at 17 with the first class degree in physics  and mathematics. All right? Yes, all right. He made his first notable achievement  at the age of 18. It was a method of refrigeration  which rolls from his work in low temperature physics. He became professor of mathematics  at the University of Manchester at 24, where he remained for twelve years. During that time, he married one of his students, Natasha Willoughby. Yes, go on. Later  working together in London, they laid the foundations of modern physics  by showing that normal laws of cause and effect  do not apply  at the level of subatomic particles. For this  he and his wife received the Nobel Prize for physics  in  1910, and did so again in 1912  for their work on very high frequency radio waves. In his lifetime, Hutton patented 244  inventions. Do you want any more? Yes, when did he go to America? Let me see. In 1920  he went to teach in New York  and died there suddenly  after only three weeks. Still  he was a good age. Yes, I suppose so. Well, thanks.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[1080,119940](1080,570,0)Hello(1650,570,0).
