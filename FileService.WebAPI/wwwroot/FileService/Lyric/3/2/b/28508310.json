I was wondering if the one professor Smith wrote for me last year could still be used. It's a bit dated. You'd better submit a recent one. What does the man suggest the woman do? Question 16  I've noticed that you spend a lot of time tending your garden. Would you like to join our gardening club? We meet every other Wednesday. Oh, thanks for the invitation, but this is how I relax. I'd rather not make it something formal and structured. What can we infer about the man? Question 17  I heard the recent sculpture exhibit was kind of disappointing. That's right. I guess a lot of other people feel the way I do about modern art. What does the woman mean? Question 18  Bob is running for chairman of the student union. Would you vote for him? Oh, I can't decide right now because I have to find out more about the other candidates.
