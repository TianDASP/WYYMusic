{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":7,"lyric":"[00:00.00] Russell Fazio, an Ohio State psychology professor  who has studied interracial roommates there  and at Indiana University, discovered an intriguing  academic effect. In a study analyzing data  on thousands of Ohio State freshmen who lived in dorms, he found that black freshmen  who came to college  with high standardized test scores  earned better grades  if they had a white roommate â€”  even if the roommate's test scores were low. The roommate's race  had no effect on the grades of white students  or low-scoring black students. Perhaps, the study speculated, having a white roommate  helps  academically prepared black students  adjust  to a predominantly white university. That same study found  that randomly assigned interracial roommates  at Ohio State  broke up before the end of the quarter  about twice as often  as same-race  roommates. \" Because  interracial roommate relationships are often problematic.\" Dr. Fazio said, \" many students would like to move out, but university housing policies  may make it hard to leave.\" \" At Indiana University, where housing was not so tight, more interracial roommates split up,\"  he said. \" Here  at Ohio State, where housing was tight, they were told to work it out. The most interesting thing we found  was that if the relationship managed to continue for just ten weeks, we could see an improvement in racial attitudes.\"  Dr. Fazio's Indiana study  found that three times as many randomly assigned interracial roommates  were no longer living together  at the end of the semester, compared with white roommates. The interracial roommates spent less time together, and had fewer joint activities  than the white pairs.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[510,117300](510,420,0)Russell (930,840,0)Fazio
