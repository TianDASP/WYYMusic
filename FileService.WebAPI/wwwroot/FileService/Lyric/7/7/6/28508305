{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":6,"lyric":"[00:00.00]Somehow  the old male and female stereotypes no longer fit. Men and women in this country  haven't been fulfilling their traditional roles for some time now. And there seem to be fewer and fewer differences between the ***es. For instance, even though more women than men are still homemakers without paying jobs, women have been taking over more responsibility in the business world, earning higher salaries than ever before  and entering fields of work that used to be exclusively male areas. At office meetings and in group discussions, they might speak up more often, express strong opinions  and come up with more creative and practical ideas than their male colleagues. Several days ago, my 23-year-old daughter  came to me with some important news. Not only had she found the highest paying job of her career, but she'd also accepted a date with the most charming men she’d ever met. \" Really?\", I responded, \" tell me about them.\" \" Receptionist in an attorney’s office and a welder at a construction site.\"  She answered in a matter-of-fact way. The interesting thing is  my daughter's date  is the receptionist  and my daughter is the welder. The old stereotypes of men's and women's work  have been changing more quickly than ever before, except  perhaps in my own marriage. \" Who's going to mow the lawn?\"  I asked my husband this morning. \" Oh, I will,\" he answered politely. \" That's men's work.\" \" What?\"  Irritated, I raised my voice. \" That's a ridiculous stereotype. I'll show you who can do the best job on the lawn.\"  The work took 3  hours  and I did it all myself.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[0,108590](0,750,0)Somehow (750,180,0)the (930,300,0)old (1230,420,0)male (1650,180,0)and (1830,450,0)female (2280,870,0)stereotypes (3150,180,0)no (3330,390,0)longer (3720,360,0)fit(4080,690,0).
