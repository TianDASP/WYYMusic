I think she'd appreciate it. Imagine how you both feel if she fixed the turkey dinner or something. What does the man suggest the woman do? Question 16 Just look at this newspaper, nothing but robbery, suicide and murder. Do you still believe people are basically good? Of course. But many papers lack interest in reporting something positive, like peace, love and generosity. What are the speakers talking about? Question 17 I can't believe so many people want to sign up for the Korea Development Conference. We'll have to limit the registration. Yeah, otherwise we won't have room for them all. What are the speakers going to do? Question 18 Hi. I'm calling about the ad for the one-bedroom apartment. Perfect timing! The person who was supposed to rent it just backed town to take a room on campus. What do we learn from the conversation?\n\n\n问题15 托尼的妈妈邀请我去吃晚饭，你觉得我应该提前告诉她我是素食主义者吗？ 当然，她会很感激的。试想一下，如果她做了火鸡什么的当晚餐，你们俩会有什么感受？ 这男的建议女的怎么做？ 问题16 看看这报纸吧，除了绑架，自杀和谋杀什么也没有，你还相信人性本善吗？ 当然，但是很多媒体没兴趣报道积极的东西，比如和平，爱和宽容。 这两人在讨论什么？ 问题17 我真不敢相信这么多人想和韩国发展协会签约。我们必须限制注册人数。 是的，否则就没有房间给他们住了。 这两人准备做什么？ 问题18 嗨，我打电话来问下单身公寓的广告。 时间正好！房东刚好回来，而且在学校里拿到个房间。 从这段对话能得出什么？"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"code":200,"roles":[]}
