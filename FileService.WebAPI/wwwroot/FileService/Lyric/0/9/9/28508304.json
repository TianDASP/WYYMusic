And with stocks, currencies  and companies all crashing, some are finding that taking the trip of a lifetime  is actually a smart move right now. Prices are good, crowds are fewer  and the dividends  like expanded worldview, lifelong memories, the satisfaction of boosting the global economy— can't be easily snatched away. Sylvia and Paul Custerson, a retired couple from Cambridge, England, recently took a 16-day vacation  to Namibia, where they went on bird-watching excursions. Later this year, they are planning a trip to Patagonia. \" We're using our capital now,\"  says Sylvia, \" And why not? We're not getting any interest in the bank. If it's a place we really want to go, then we will go. We may as well travel while we're fit and healthy. \"  Some travel agents  are thriving in spite of the economy. \" We've had more people booking  in the first quarter of this year than last,\" says Hubert Moineau, founder of Tselana Travel, which is planning to introduce  a new program  of longer adventure trips, including polar expeditions  and cruises  in the Galápagos. \" We're hearing things like, 'We don't know what the situation will be in six months  so let's travel now' \", Ashley Toft, managing director  of the U. K. tour operator  Explore  has been surprised to see an increase  in last-minute bookings  of high-priced trips  to such places  as India, Bhutan  and Nepal. \" It seems people would rather give up something else  than the big trip,\"  he says. Travel has become a necessity. It's just how we travel that is changing.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[1020,113130](1020,450,0)Everyone (1470,120,0)is (1590,480,0)looking (2070,180,0)for (2250,90,0)a (2340,240,0)good (2580,600,0)investment (3180,270,0)these (3450,300,0)days(3750,750,0).
