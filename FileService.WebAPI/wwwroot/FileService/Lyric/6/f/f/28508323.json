{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":7,"lyric":"[00:00.00] It's difficult to estimate the number of youngsters involved in home schooling  where children are not sent to school  and receive their formal education from one or both parents. Legislation and court decisions have made it legally possible in most states  for parents to educate their children at home  and each year more people take advantage of that opportunity. Some states require parents or a home tutor  to meet teacher certification standards, and many require parents to complete legal forms to verify that their children are receiving instruction  in state approved curriculum. Supporters of home education claim that it is less expensive  and far more efficient than mass public education. Moreover  they site several advantages: alleviation of school overcrowding, strengthened family relationships, lower dropout rates, the fact that students are allowed  to learn at their own rate, increased motivation, higher standardized test scores, and reduced discipline problems. Critics of the home schooling movement contend  that it creates as many problems as it solves. They acknowledge that, in a few cases, home schooling offers educational opportunities  superior to those found in most public schools, but few parents can provide such educational advantages. Some parents who withdraw their children from the schools in favor of home schooling  have an inadequate educational background  and insufficient formal training to provide a satisfactory education for their children. Typically, parents have fewer technological resources at their disposal  than do schools. However, the relatively inexpensive computer technology that is readily available today  is causing some to challenge the notion that home schooling is in any way inferior  to more highly structured classroom education.\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[630,127200](630,330,0)It's
