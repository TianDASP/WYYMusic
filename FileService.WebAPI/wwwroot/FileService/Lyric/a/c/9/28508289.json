{"sgc":false,"sfy":true,"qfy":true,"lrc":{"version":6,"lyric":"[00:00.00] There are roughly three New Yorks. There is, first, the New York of the man or woman  who was born here, who takes the city for granted  and accepts its size  and its turbulence as natural  and inevitable. Second, there is the New York  of the commuter. The city that is swallowed up by locusts  each day  and spat out  each night. Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something. Of these three trembling cities the greatest is the last, the city of final destination, the city that has a goal. It is this third city  that accounts for New York's high-strung disposition, its dedication to the arts, and its incomparable  achievements. Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness. Natives give it solidity  and continuity. But the settlers give it passion. And whether it is a farmer arriving from Italy to set up a small grocery store in a slum, or a young girl arriving from a small town in Mississippi to escape the indignity of being observed  by her neighbors, or a boy arriving from the Corn Belt  with a manuscript in his suitcase  and a pain in his heart, it makes no difference, each embraces New York  with the intense  excitement of first love, each absorbs New York with the fresh  eyes of an adventurer, each generates heat  and light to dwarf the Consolidated Edison Company. Question30  What does the speaker say about the natives  of New York? Question31  What does the speaker say commuters give to New York? Question32  What do we learn about the settlers of New York?\n"},"klyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"tlyric":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"romalrc":{"version":0,"lyric":""},"yrc":{"version":2,"lyric":"[ch:0]\n[720,105670](720,210,0)There (930,120,0)are (1050,420,0)roughly (1470,360,0)three (1830,180,0)New (2010,720,0)Yorks(2730,300,0).
